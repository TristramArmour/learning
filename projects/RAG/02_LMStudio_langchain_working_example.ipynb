      " It's actually pretty simple.\n",
      "The color of the sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which was first described by Lord Rayleigh in the late 19th century. In short, it's due to the way that light interacts with tiny molecules of gases in the Earth's atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what happens: When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters these tiny gas molecules, such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so they scatter shorter wavelengths more efficiently. In other words, they bounce off the blue and violet parts of the light spectrum more effectively than the longer wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "This scattering effect is responsible for the blue color we see in the sky during the daytime. The shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered in all directions by the gas molecules, reaching our eyes from all over the sky. As a result, the sky appears blue to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that this scattering effect also explains why sunsets often appear orange or reddish. During these times, the sun is lower in the sky, and the light it emits has to travel longer distances through the atmosphere. This means that more of the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered away\n"
