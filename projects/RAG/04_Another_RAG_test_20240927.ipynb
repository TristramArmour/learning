But there\\'s more to it.\\nOpen Source can be super helpful for software developers. It makes you unique, gives you real work experience, helps you learn new programming skills, and, most importantly, shows you how to contribute to existing code projects when starting out.\\nAt Tublian, we\\'ve seen that many developers struggle to get into the Open Source world, mainly because there is no structured curriculum-based approach to starting with Open source. That\\'s why, in line with our goal to help developers supercharge their careers and get noticed, we\\'ve launched a 30-day Open Source Internship.\\nHere are some testimonials from developers who went through the Internship:\\n\\nA sneak peak into the progress of my internship @tublian. I think so far, this has really helped me in understanding more about contributing to open source - @Blossomeze_\\nOne of the most significant highlights of my post-certification journey has been becoming a member of the Tublian community.
